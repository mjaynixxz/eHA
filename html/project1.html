    <h1>EDO STATE</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Edo State is a state in Nigeria. Its capital is Benin City. <em>The 2014 estimated population of the Edo state is 5 million people</em>. It is made up of 4 major ethnic groups; namely the Bini, Esan, Owan, and Etsako. 
        However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City the capital has a history of being one of the
        remost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of the African continent many centuries ago. 
        Some of the flash points have remained tourists attractions for the state.</p>

    <h2>THE NATIONAL MUSEUM</h2>
 <br />
        <p>The National Museum preserves the history of Benin dating back the twelfth century in a beautiful way. They store and display loads of traditional art, brasses, cast iron pieces. Sadly, there are pieces of works which are not physically displayed but photographs, thanks to the British. These are art pieces which were stolen 
            by the British during the sacking and destruction of the city and are now displayed in the British Museum. Phew.....</p>
