        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says">I am always sad due to the fact i havent gain enough technical knowledge to  achieve a greater career. Anytime i think about that it makes me sad. i love technology and i want to further have more knowledge than ever</p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"></p>
        <script>
            var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");

            ohnoesSays.innerHTML = "I am always sad due to the fact i havent <em>gain enough technical knowledge</em> to  achieve a <strong>greater career</strong>. Anytime i think about that it makes me sad. <strong>I love technology</strong> and i want to further have more knowledge than ever";
            winstonSays.textContent = "He's my buddy, i keep encouraging him. I always tell him positively that he would be a tech guru, that i believe. that tends to cheer him up a bit :-)";
